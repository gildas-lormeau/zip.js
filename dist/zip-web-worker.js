	 * <p>
	 * Most of our crypto primitives operate on arrays of 4-byte words internally,
	 * but many of them can take arguments that are not a multiple of 4 bytes.
	 * This library encodes arrays of bits (whose size need not be a multiple of 8
	 * bits) as arrays of 32-bit words.  The bits are packed, big-endian, into an
	 * array of words, 32 bits at a time.  Since the words are double-precision
	 * floating point numbers, they fit some extra data.  We use this (in a private,
	 * possibly-changing manner) to encode the number of bits actually  present
	 * in the last word of the array.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Because bitwise ops clear this out-of-band data, these arrays can be passed
	 * to ciphers like AES which want arrays of words.
